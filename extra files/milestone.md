# MILESTONE TO FINISH THE PROJECT

### Milestone 1 - Prompt Collection & Cleaning (15 hrs)
- Gather prompts from different backgrounds (users + non-users).
- Clean and organize prompts into categories (social, workplace, healthcare, etc.).
- Store them in a structured format (JSON/DB).

### Milestone 2 - Baseline Bias Testing (20 hrs). bias_testing.py. add nlp and detoxify
- Run prompts through base LLMs ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama.
- Record outputs + note bias issues.
- Build a baseline bias benchmark (examples of unfair responses).

### Milestone 3 - Bias Measurement Tools (15 hrs). bias_metrics.py
- Develop simple metrics/tools to measure bias (fairness scores, inclusivity checks).
- Highlight recurring bias patterns (stereotypes, cultural insensitivity, etc.).
- Create a report with clear examples.

### Milestone 4 - Bias Mitigation Pipeline (25 hrs)
- Design a pipeline to reduce bias (prompt-engineering, fine-tuning, or LoRA).
- Test the pipeline with the dataset.
- Compare "before vs after" results to show improvements.

### Milestone 5 - Documentation & Reproducibility (15 hrs)
- Write clear notes on setup (venv, installations, folder structure).
- Explain how to run tests, collect prompts, and apply bias-fixes.
- Make everything easy to reproduce for future use.

### Milestone 6 - Final Report & Delivery (10 hrs)
- Prepare a final report + presentation.
- Show bias problems, metrics, and improvements.
- Provide recommendations for future scaling.
