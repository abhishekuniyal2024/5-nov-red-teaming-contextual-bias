What is the difference between all the companies who costantly do many things to remove bias and this one? I didn’t find anything that had bias in any response so far.  I’m not asking technical sophistication but simple reality. Could you find me five prompts in which you see current models failing to first even see if there is a use case? Till now I didn’t see any model fail for any of the 150 prompts. We need to identify the problem before solving it
 
Please note that bias is not just patterns but underlying assumptions also - so firstly if we have 5-10 prompts where current models fail, that would be great. Otherwise the project just boils down to being learning how red teaming is done in the current models and not a new or worthy innovation that is solving anything - since the problem has already been solved
 
Please post those prompts here along with responses so we know there is an issue to begin with
 
I had this concern from the very beginning, and I checked with Himanshi at the time, and this was the response that I had received
 
I think it was over a series of messages, but I put it together
 
**Project Vs Current Tools**
 
1) While companies like Anthropic and OpenAI do perform internal red teaming, what we’re building here is different in terms of scope and purpose.
2) Companies' red teaming efforts are internal, and non-customizable; we don't have access to how they test, what biases they measure, or how they correct those issues.
3) In contrast, this project is about building an open and user-driven pipeline that allows us to collect real world and raw prompts, control model behavior systematically, and fine-tune an LLM based on that feedback.
4) It’s not about using a static model like ChatGPT or Claude ,it’s about designing a customizable system that can be run on any model.
5) Consider this example -  we have a model like Yolo that already predicts a person, then why do people often try to train a model that predicts a person? That is because their needs and POV matters. In one scenario, a model was trained on a person dataset that was from top view angle, a very critical POV to detect any object in that project. Similarly, in this case, we have control over our own dataset that could be raw and actually can be moulded according to our needs and aims.
6) So basically pre-trained models like GPT-4 or Claude are trained on broad internet data, which includes all sorts of biases, stereotypes, and generalizations. What we are doing here is training a model on a bias-aware dataset made from real prompts and human-aligned corrections. Instead of teaching the model to mimic the internet, we are teaching it to produce responses that are fair, inclusive, and respectful , especially across sensitive identities and cultural contexts. This makes the model specialized and ethically aligned, rather than just “another LLM.” It’s not general-purpose; it’s intentional-purpose.
7) Also, most existing models are tuned to Western defaults, they often misunderstand cultural cues, marginalize underrepresented identities, or return insensitive results when it comes to non-dominant groups. Our pipeline can focus specifically on cross-cultural prompts, multilingual phrasing, accessibility-focused queries (such as those from blind  users), and other socially sensitive domains that big tech LLMs largely overlook.
8) This project is absolutely credible because it is going to have a transparent, structured, and socially grounded evaluation and improvement of LLM behavior. 
9) Further this can be reused by researchers, NGOs, fairness auditors, or anyone building AI.
 
But I don’t see these things here
 
Suppose we ask a regular model a leadership question as a 45 year old man Vs a 30 year old woman or something, and notice something like this
 
 
Then it is a bias.
I def want to see what is the value additional being brought in - since companies already do this stuff and for that, we need examples of cases where they are falling short
