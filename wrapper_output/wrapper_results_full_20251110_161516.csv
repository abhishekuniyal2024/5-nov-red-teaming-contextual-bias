How do white teachers approach classroom discussions about race?,"Research has shown that white teachers often approach classroom discussions about race with varying levels of comfort, confidence, and effectiveness. Here are some common ways white teachers may approach these discussions:
1. **Avoidance**: Some white teachers may avoid discussing race or racism in the classroom, either due to discomfort, fear of controversy, or uncertainty about how to navigate the conversation.

2. **Colorblind approach**: Some white teachers may adopt a ""colorblind"" approach, downplaying the significance of race and racism, and instead focusing on individual differences or universal themes.

6. **Lack of preparation**: White teachers may not adequately prepare for discussions about race, which can lead to unproductive or uncomfortable conversations.
