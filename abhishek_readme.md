## this project is created on 5 nov 2025. i am using contextual_bias approach.
- i will have to deliver this project by tuesday 11-nov.
- set temp to 0 and random_seed fix 0. so answer will most likely remain same. 

## **installation guide:**
- create env: python3.10 -m venv venv
- activate env: source venv/bin/activate
- install library: pip install -r requirements.txt

- do it if only if it gave error during sentence-transformers, other wise dont do it: pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

---

## **TO DO LIST**

- should i set temperature to 0 in bias_wrapper.py
- should i keep or remove date from file name. i think i should remove it cause i have to send it to the client.
- if i remove date from file anme, then i have to make changes in all code.

- ask tl what spacy library version i should install. spacy earlier gave lots of issue.
# Load SpaCy NLP model safely
try:
    import spacy
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
except (ImportError, OSError):
    logging.info("Installing SpaCy model en_core_web_sm ...")
    subprocess.run([
        sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install",
        "https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/"
        "en_core_web_sm-3.8.0/en_core_web_sm-3.8.0-py3-none-any.whl"
    ], check=True)
    import spacy
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

keep this in requiremnets.txt file: spacy==3.8.0
https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.8.0/en_core_web_sm-3.8.0-py3-none-any.whl

## **core files**

- **dataset/ dataset.json:** new data which has 2 option for each prompt. new created data is based on race, gender, intersectional.

- **dataset_response/ dataset_response.csv:** response created by milestone1_gen_output.py. on this data i will run my   milestone2_contextual_bias_testing.py

- **bias_analysis_output/ contextual_bias_results.csv:** file generated by analyze_bias_metrics.py. it has context_bias scoring. it also has file generated by extract_high_bias and prepare_fine_tune_dataset.py

- **generate_llm_responses.py:** it will generate response from 3 llm and create new file from it in folder dataset_response.

- **analyze_bias_metrics.py:** it will work on file 'dataset_response.csv' that will be generated from milestone1_gen_output.py to give contextual_bias_results.csv and contextual_bias_comparison_with_bias_notes in bias_analysis_output folder.

- **extract_high_bias**: will be “bias-flagged” eg for neutralization or preference training. produce a file fine_tune_candidates.csv

- **prepare_fine_tune_dataset.py**: produces a fine_tune_dataset.jsonl file you can feed into any fine-tuning pipeline.

- **bias_wrapper.py**: Applies a bias-mitigation wrapper around the LLaMA-4 Maverick model (via Groq API).

- **extra files/ :** extra files like client msg, client image, bad dataset response, milestone, response to client.
